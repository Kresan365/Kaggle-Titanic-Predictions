# Kaggle-Titanic-Predictions

This is a simple repositary to maintain the code I used for a beginner kaggle competition on machine learning based on predicting whether a person survived the Titanic crash or not.

# Conclusions from data

1. Women and young adults had much higher survival rates than males and people from other age groups.
2. People who had paid more for their ticket also had some tendency to be given importance.
3. The number of spouses and children were inversely related - the more relatives  you have, the lower your survival rate
